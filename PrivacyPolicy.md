Last updated: 25/08/2023

This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information that the BigQuery Cost Estimator Chrome extension ("We", "Our", or "Us") may collect and how we handle such information.

## 1. What Information Do We Collect?

The BigQuery Cost Estimator extension reads the query details displayed on the Google BigQuery Console to calculate estimated costs. This includes:

- Size of the data being queried (e.g., KB, MB, GB).
- Textual details associated with the query.

**Please note:** No personal or identifiable information is accessed or collected by the extension.

## 2. How Do We Use the Information?

The accessed query details are used solely within the extension to:

- Calculate the estimated cost of the query.
- Display the estimated cost directly in the Google BigQuery Console interface.

We do not store, transmit, or share any of the accessed information.

## 3. Data Storage and Transmission

The extension does not store or transmit any data outside of your browser. All calculations and data manipulations occur in real-time within the extension, and no data is sent to external servers or third parties.

## 4. User Consent

By using the BigQuery Cost Estimator extension, you consent to the access of query details as described above. You can disable or uninstall the extension at any time to revoke this consent.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
